Automatically unflatten a 3d model to a 2d pattern (for laser cut and manual assembly).

Most recent source is into Puzzlz_Moai directory, with the example model of a 156 triangles geometrical model.

It needs a 3d model saved as .stl file. When the file is on another format, I convert it with Meshlab.
The .stl file needs to be wrapped into a jscad script, with this command that will create modele_stl.jscad :
```
node stl2jscad file (this will use file.stl)
```

Model scale can be adjusted when unflattening with this parameter : --echelle 10 (to expand x10).
If the model needs to be rescaled (I use Meshlab for that), just remember to save it to .stl ascii and without colors.

The model is then unflatten with :
```
openjscad depliev3.jscad > rendu.dat
```
Optional parameters are : (default format is a4)
- --format 'a3' will pack the pattern into a3 pages (possibles values are a1 to a4)
- --triangle '...' is optional and will force each page (before sorting by size) to start with provided triangle
- --echelle 0.75 will scale the model ( < 1 to reduce, > 1 to expand)

From v5, the generated pattern can be customized by excluding facets couples, by editing file deplie.jscad, and change a.npl array. If this script is used to unflatten a new model, this array must be cleared, then filled as needed.

Finally, the pattern pdf file is created with :
```
node pdf file.pdf a4 1
```
- file.pdf will be the name of the pdf
- a4 will be the page format
- 1 will be the scale of numbers (useful when the default is too small/big)

The folds kind (valley or mountain) will be shown on different color, maroon for mountain and green for valley.

From v5, it is possible to create a pattern with puzzle like notches. To do so, pdf.js must be replace by pdfP.js (run command node pdfP file.pdf...). Notches can be customized by editing file rendu.dat.

It requires :
- nodejs (https://nodejs.org/en/)
- OpenJSCAD CLI (npm install -g @jscad/openjscad)
- pdfkit (npm install pdfkit)
